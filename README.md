# Humpass

Ruby Application for Creating random passwords and storing them secured.

You should have a password for each service that you use, but keep these passwords in order is essencially hard because, of course, they are different form each other.

SO... You don't need to know them at all.

That's what this app does. It generate passwords for each service and them, it manages it for you securely.

How about that?
